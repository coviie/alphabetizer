B. ** Purpose of program **
   The program orders input strings based on their ASCII character values.
   Input strings are stored either from user input, or based off input from a
   given file. 
   At the end of the input, the program prints out all strings in forward
   or reverse order (based off user's choice).
   
   The strings will aslo be stored in a binary search tree.

C. ** Uploads **
  -= StringBST =-
  - StringBST.h		        StringBST class definition that serves to construct
                          and maintain a valid Binary Search Tree (that 
                          stores strings and their frequencies). Also 
                          contains functions that can change the state of
                          the tree (e.g. adding and removing).
  - StringBST.cpp	        The implementation for the StringBST class
  
  -= Alphabetizer =-
  - Alphabetizer.h	    Alphabetizer class definition that runs the 
                        Alphabetizer. It should be able to read in input
                        from the cmdline/a file, and then print out the
                        stored contents when prompted (i.e. eof).
  - Alphabetizer.cpp	  The implementation for the Alphabetizer class

  
D. ** How to compile and run **
   As there exists a Makefile:
       compile: make
       run:     [for interactive mode]: ./alphabetizer
                [for automated mode]:   ./alphabetizer order filename
